#### Description: 
This webpage gives instant feedback and solutions to math problems. Allowing the user to know if their answer is correct or not. It also provides a timer to test how long it takes.
#### How it works: 
This webpage is a math testing site to help anyone test how quick they can solve math operations precisely. By cliquing on the start button the math problems will apear and this will start the timer.  By sending the answers it will automatically say weather the answer of each operation is correct or incorrect.When is submited the timer stops and the webpage will output your score at the bottom of the page.
#### files: 
In this project there are 3 different files. First of all there is an html file called index. This file that contains the .html file extension stores the web page that has been created using the Hyper Text Markup Language. THe HTML file is created for the purpose of being displayed in the user's Web browser.Then there is a JavaScript file called main. In this file there is the code needed to make the webpage interactive. The code is executed when called from. In the buttons to start and submit in the webpage, a function is called to make it work. All this is coded in JavaScrip, JavaScript is the default scripting language in HTML.And lastly there is a css file that makes the webpage look good called stylesheet. The style sheet language manages the websiteâ€™s visual representation giving the overall site a more appealing look.
#### Design choices: 
The colour for the background i debated for a while trying to figure out which one to use. I decided to use red, because since i was a little girl in my school red was allways the colour that represented MATHS. For the rest pf the webpage I kept it simple and neat.
#### inspiration: 
My inspiration was to create an academic webpage that gives feedback in real time. Allowing students to learn faster and learn about their mistakes. It is a program any one can use. It can be used for kids learning basic math by themselves, without having a teacher next to them to tell them if it is right or wrong.
